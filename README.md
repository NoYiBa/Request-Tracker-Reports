Request-Tracker-Reports
=======================

Simple scripts to generate reports from Request Tracker to measure response and resolution times for requests.

Script Placement
----------------

It's entirely up to the user to determine where these scripts live.  Out of personal convention, I store them under /usr/local/bin/.

NOTE: rtBatchReports.sh calls various scripts from /usr/local/bin.  Modfiy accordingly.
